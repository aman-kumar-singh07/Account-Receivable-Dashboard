# Account-Receivable-Dashboard


An accounts receivable dashboard is a visual representation of key financial metrics and data related to a company's outstanding invoices and payments from customers. This dashboard provides a quick and comprehensive overview of the company's financial health in terms of its ability to collect payments from customers in a timely manner. It helps financial managers and executives make informed decisions and take necessary actions to manage and improve the company's cash flow.

Here's a description of what an accounts receivable dashboard might include:

Summary Metrics: The dashboard would typically start with summary metrics displayed prominently. These could include:

Total Accounts Receivable: The total amount of money owed by customers.

Average Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): The average number of days it takes to collect payments from customers.

Total Outstanding Invoices: The number of invoices that are yet to be paid.

Total Collected: The total amount of money collected from customers during a specific time period.

Aging Analysis: The dashboard may feature an aging analysis chart or graph that categorizes outstanding invoices based on their age. Common categories are usually 0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and over 90 days. This helps identify which invoices are overdue and need immediate attention.

Top Customers: A section could highlight the top customers with the highest outstanding balances. This information is important for focusing collection efforts on accounts that contribute significantly to the company's revenue.

Payment Trends: The dashboard might display trends in payment behavior, showing how the company's collections have changed over time. This could be visualized through line charts or bar graphs.
